# BlockieChan

A very basic blockchain in java made to understand and try some things within this technology.

It was made using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [GSON library](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.6.2/gson-2.6.2.jar), [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) and [Based on NoobChain by CryptoKass](https://github.com/CryptoKass/NoobChain-Tutorial-Part-1)

## Usage

There isn't much usage of this beyond learn and see how it works, but for it you gonna need a java ide and to point the two libraries appended to the project (gson & Bouncy Castle) to compile it, otherwise it wont work.

```bash
Use the force and get your favorite java ide for this thing.
```

## What is working

- Generate Blocks
- Verify Blocks
- Transactions (kinda of)
